# Running our services locally

## Step 1: setup your `.env`

We recommend using what is available in the `.env.sample` file as it contains versions of our services guaranteed to be compatible with each other:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

Simply, edit your `.env` and set `RPC_NODE_URL` to the chain you want the services running against.
**Important Note:** Only L2 safes are supported in the setup provided. Change this at your own risk.

## Step 2: Setup Django superusers

### Option #1 - Automated way
We provide a script to automate this second step, if you want to use it, simply write:
```
cd scripts
sh run_locally.sh
```

### Option #2 - Manual way
Start Docker containers:
```bash
docker compose up
```

You will need to identify the ID or name of the containers using `docker ps`. To create the default super user for the Safe Config Service, we run the following command:

```bash
docker compose exec cfg-web python src/manage.py createsuperuser --noinput
```

You can now access http://localhost:8000/cfg/admin/ and login using the credentials `root/admin`.

To achieve the same for the Safe Transaction service:

```bash
docker compose exec txs-web python manage.py createsuperuser --username root
```

Note 1: note that the path to `manage.py` is different. In case you need to run other commands.

## Step 3: Add your `ChainInfo`

We need to be able to define a `ChainInfo` object in the Safe Config service so that the Client Gateway knows the URL of the Safe Transaction service instance it needs to request against for a given safe.

You can do this in the admin interface of the Safe Config service: `http://localhost:8000/cfg/admin/chains/chain/add/`

You can verify that your `ChainInfo` was successfully added by going to `http://localhost:8000/cfg/api/v1/chains`.

Remember to edit your `ChainInfo` json fields `transaction_service_uri` and `vpc_transaction_service_uri` to point to your local instance of the transaction service. The values should be `http://nginx:8000/txs`

Check this [section](chain_info.md) for a more complete guide on the fields for `ChainInfo`.

## Step 4: Add your webhooks

Our services invalidate the caches of the client gateway using webhooks. Both the Config and Transaction service need to be configured. For the Config service, unless you've changed the values in `cgw.env` and `cfg.env` then you don't need to do anything, otherwise:

```bash

# Inside the file "container_env_files/cfg.env"
#...
CGW_URL=http://nginx:8000/cgw
CGW_FLUSH_TOKEN=some_random_token

# Inside the file "container_env_files/cgw.env"
WEBHOOK_TOKEN=some_random_token
```

`WEBHOOK_TOKEN` and `CGW_FLUSH_TOKEN` must be the same.

For the Transactions service, follow these steps:
 - Access the admin panel at `http://localhost:8000/txs/admin`
 - click the `Add` link for `Web hooks`
 - Ignore the `Address` field
 - Set the `Url` field to `http://nginx:8000/cgw/v1/chains/{chainId}/hooks/events` and replace `{chainId}` with the corresponding chainId
 - Set the `Authorization` field to `Basic <WEBHOOK_TOKEN>`, where `<WEBHOOK_TOKEN>` corresponds to the value of `WEBHOOK_TOKEN` in the `container_env_files/cgw.env` file of this repository

# Safe Web App

The Safe Web app will be available at at http://localhost:8080 although check the output of `docker compose` to see that the container is already running, as in some step-ups, it can take longer than expected ( >15 minutes).

To configure the port in which the Safe Web app will be reachable, look into our sample [.env](../.env.sample) file. The value of `REVERSE_PROXY_UI_PORT` defines this.

Add your `NEXT_PUBLIC_INFURA_TOKEN` value if its required for the chain RCP uri in the [container_env_files/ui.env](../container_env_files/ui.env) file.

Additionally, the Safe Web app itself, defines which instance of the Safe CGW to use in this [container_env_files/ui.env](../container_env_files/ui.env) file. The value of `NEXT_PUBLIC_GATEWAY_URL_PRODUCTION` defines the URL where the Safe CGW can be reached. The default in this repo, points to the instance running as part of the `docker-compose.yml` file, but can be adjusted to point to our production instances, or your own hosted instance.
